# Sample files

Unzip the `testfiles.zip` which came from the repository, to this directory.

The sample files are used in testing the implementations. Various `go.sh` files in the implementations try to read these files from the samples directory.

Executing the implementations fail if the zip file is not unzipped and sample files available.
